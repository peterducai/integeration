//constructed from ratios (or fractions) of integers.

//A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction p/q of two integers, a numerator p and a non-zero denominator q.
//Since q may be equal to 1, every integer is a rational number. The set of all rational numbers, often referred to as "the rationals", the field of
// rationals or the field of rational numbers is usually denoted by a boldface Q
//
//Among irrational numbers are the ratio π of a circle's circumference to its diameter, Euler's number e, the golden ratio φ, and the square root of two
//
//As a consequence of Cantor's proof that the real numbers are uncountable and the rationals countable, it follows that almost all real numbers are irrational.
