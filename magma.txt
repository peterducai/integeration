// A magma is a set M matched with an operation, •, that sends any two elements a, b ∈ M to another element, a • b. The symbol, •, is a general placeholder for a properly defined operation. To qualify as a magma, the set and operation (M, •) must satisfy the following requirement (known as the magma or closure axiom):

// For all a, b in M, the result of the operation a • b is also in M.
// And in mathematical notation:

// {\displaystyle a,b\in M\implies a\cdot b\in M}{\displaystyle a,b\in M\implies a\cdot b\in M}.
// If • is instead a partial operation, then S is called a partial magma[5] or more often a partial groupoid.




Types of magma
Magmas are not often studied as such; instead there are several different kinds of magma, depending on what axioms the operation is required to satisfy. Commonly studied types of magma include:

Quasigroup
A magma where division is always possible
Loop
A quasigroup with an identity element
Semigroup
A magma where the operation is associative
Inverse semigroup
A semigroup with inverse.
Semilattice
A semigroup where the operation is commutative and idempotent
Monoid
A semigroup with an identity element
Group
A monoid with inverse elements, or equivalently, an associative loop, or a non-empty associative quasigroup
Abelian group
A group where the operation is commutative
Note that each of divisibility and invertibility imply the cancellation property.
