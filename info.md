Throughout abstract algebra, the term "magma" is most often used as a synonym of the more antiquated term "groupoid, " referring to a set equipped with a binary operator. The term is thought to have originated with Bourbaki.
Unlike the term "groupoid" which has a number of different uses across algebra, the term "magma" has the benefit of being essentially unused in other contexts. On the other hand, the use of the term "magma" appears to be somewhat less common in literature.





There are at least three definitions of "groupoid" currently in use.
The first type of groupoid is an algebraic structure on a set with a binary operator. The only restriction on the operator is closure (i.e., applying the binary operator to two elements of a given set S returns a value which is itself a member of S). Associativity, commutativity, etc., are not required. A groupoid can be empty. The numbers of nonisomorphic groupoids of this type having n = 1, 2, ... elements are 1, 10, 3330, 178981952, ... (OEIS A001329), and the corresponding numbers of nonisomorphic and nonantiisomorphic groupoids are 1, 7, 1734, 89521056, ... (OEIS A001424). An associative groupoid is called a semigroup.





A monoid is a set that is closed under an associative binary operation and has an identity element I element S such that for all a element S, Ia = aI = a. Note that unlike a group, its elements need not have inverses. It can also be thought of as a semigroup with an identity element.
A monoid must contain at least one element.
A monoid that is commutative is, not surprisingly, known as a commutative monoid.




An operator defined on a set S which takes two elements from S as inputs and returns a single element of S. Binary operators are called compositions by Rosenfeld. Sets possessing a binary multiplication operation include the group, groupoid, monoid, quasigroup, and semigroup. Sets possessing both a binary multiplication and a binary addition operation include the division algebra, field, ring, ringoid, semiring, and unit ring.





Another word for a C^∞ (infinitely differentiable) manifold, also called a differentiable manifold. A smooth manifold is a topological manifold together with its "functional structure" and so differs from a topological manifold because the notion of differentiability exists on it. Every smooth manifold is a topological manifold, but not necessarily vice versa. (The first nonsmooth topological manifold occurs in four dimensions.) Milnor showed that a seven-dimensional hypersphere can be made into a smooth manifold in 28 ways.

A manifold is a topological space that is locally Euclidean (i.e., around every point, there is a neighborhood that is topologically the same as the open unit ball in R^n). To illustrate this idea, consider the ancient belief that the Earth was flat as contrasted with the modern evidence that it is round. The discrepancy arises essentially from the fact that on the small scales that we see, the Earth does indeed look flat. In general, any object that is nearly "flat" on small scales is a manifold, and so manifolds constitute a generalization of objects we could live on in which we would encounter the round/flat Earth problem, as first codified by Poincaré.
More concisely, any object that can be "charted" is a manifold.
